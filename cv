Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Associate Software Engineer position because I believe my skills, academic background, 
and project experience align closely with the role. Currently in my final year of a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology, 
I have built a strong foundation in software development, data analytics, and real-time applications that prepare me to 
contribute meaningfully to your team.

In my recent projects, I designed and developed GreenRoute AI, a smart mobility solution leveraging React, Leaflet Maps, 
and backend APIs for real-time route optimization. I also worked on DeepTarget, an AI-powered mineral exploration system, 
where I implemented predictive mapping and depth modeling using geospatial datasets. Additionally, I developed a Virtual 
Canvas Painter using YOLOv5 and Mediapipe for real-time gesture-based drawing‚Äîan experience that strengthened my expertise 
in computer vision and deep learning.

During my internships at Paarsh Infotech (Data Analyst) and MIT ERP Office, I gained valuable exposure to real-world 
problem-solving, where I contributed to process automation and data-driven insights. I have also completed certifications
and simulations from Deloitte, Walmart, and Google, further strengthening my professional readiness.

Beyond technical skills, I have consistently demonstrated leadership and teamwork through my active involvement in NSS and 
tech clubs, where I collaborated with peers on community projects and technical initiatives. I bring strong problem-solving 
abilities, adaptability, and a willingness to learn‚Äîqualities I believe are essential for success in a fast-paced, global 
work environment.

I am eager to bring my technical expertise, project experience, and collaborative spirit to your organization. I look forward
to the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects and grow as part of your team.

Sincerely,
Yash Dhudat
